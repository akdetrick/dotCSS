# A hammer, in CSS

```css
#sidebar .post .meta > a.author {
	text-decoration: underline !important;
	color: #0366d6 !important;
	font-style: italic !important;
}
```

^Selecting an element and bludgeoning it with style properties until it looks right
^It is a blunt instrument for styling, and usually does more damage than good

---

```css, [.highlight: 1]
#sidebar .post .meta > a.author {
	text-decoration: underline !important;
	color: #0366d6 !important;
	font-style: italic !important;
}
```

^This is often done intentionally to override other styles

```css, [.highlight: 2-4]
#sidebar .post .meta > a.author {
	text-decoration: underline !important;
	color: #0366d6 !important;
	font-style: italic !important;
}
```

^Clearly, someone was trying to select one specific element, in a specific area, on a specific page, to bludgeon it with styles until it looked correct

# [fit] How do we break the cycle?

---

# Make it your goal to
# [fit] **WRITE LESS CSS**

---

## Breaking the cycle

* frame the problem correctly
* think about the developer experience
* focus on the decision point at which developers need to add more CSS
* reduce design fragmentation

---

## Utility classes to the rescue

![inline](classes_flush.png)

^if these classes already exist and are easier to remember, you don't have to write extra CSS

^These are "purely presentational"

---

`.row`, `.row-item`, `.row-item--shrink`

![inline](classes_row.png)

---

`.text--caption`, `.text--error`

![inline](classes_text.png)

---

# [fit] `.at[Breakpoint]_[property]--[variant]`

---

TODO:
show examples of media-conditional classes

---

Breakpoints        | Property       | Variants
------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------
`medium`, `large`  | `align`        | `center`, `right`, `left`
`medium`, `large`  | `display`      | `none`, `block`, `flex`, `inline`, `inlineBlock`, `inlineFlex`
`medium`, `large`  | `padding`      | `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, `none`
`medium`, `large`  | `margin`       | `center`
`medium`, `large`  | `border`       | `top`, `none`
`medium`, `large`  | `visibility`   | `a11yHide`, `a11yShow`
`medium`, `large`  | `width`        | `auto`, `full`

---

# Benefits of utility classes

* small, sharp tools
* quickly assemble layouts in markup instead of writing styles from scratch
* apply classes to markup instead of adding CSS
* "style by memory"

^It's not all "paint by classes"; they just provide a good foundation

---

# Presentational classes are scary

![inline](article.png)

---

# Presentational classes are scary

* _"there are too many class names in one element, and the class name doesn't   describe the actual meaning [of the content]"_
* _"I hope this is a cruel joke that you're trying to play on people, because this sounds like the worst idea I've ever seen for CSS! You may as well be writing all your CSS with inline style tags."_
* _"What's this shit. You write CSS like 5 years ago."_

# Don't forget to
# [fit] **WRITE LESS CSS!**

---

## Who needs to read `class` attributes?

* __Users?__ Other attributes (`rel`, `role`, `title`, `alt`) are more useful than `class`
* __Machines?__ Tag choices and microdata (`itemscope`/`itemprop`) are more descriptive than `class`
* __Developers!__ The `class` attribute is most useful to developers building features

---

# Level of abstraction

Too specific:

```css
.border--top--black--4px { ... }
.padding--left--21px { ... }
```
<br />

Just right:

```css
.text--display1 { ... }
.media--xl { ... }
```
