How do you make CSS easier to work with? Write less of it.

The more CSS we write, the more difficult our stylesheets are to work with. When stylesheets are difficult to work with, we're likely to write more CSS. This leads to more bugs, less consistency, and more frustration for developers.

This talk will focus on both technical and human problems related to maintaining CSS and a few solutions that have worked best at Meetup in our pursuit to write less CSS.

Whether you're working with a legacy website or building a new React application with component-specific styles, I'll show you how the best CSS is the CSS you don't write.
